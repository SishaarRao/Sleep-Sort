# Sleep-Sort
This repository is a demonstration of Sleep Sort in Shell

I wrote about this algorithm [here!](https://dev.to/sishaarrao/sleep-sort-where-theory-meets-sobering-reality-b3m)

## Requirements

This Sleep-Sort demonstration requires the execution of a script file

i.e. Bash

## Usage

Run the main file ``main.sh`` and add the elements of your list after

``
$ bash main.sh 1 5 4 2
``


## Updates

Thank you to [@bradoyler](https://github.com/bradoyler) for providing an implementation of Sleep Sort in Javascript!
